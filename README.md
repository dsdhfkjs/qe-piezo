# qe-piezo
Computational piezoelectricity using Quantum ESPRESSO
* `Report.txt` - daily progress
* `To Do.txt` - data and future work
* `dos.sh` - calculate density of states for any material (in progress)
* `piezo.sh` - calculate the elastic stiffness and piezoelectric tensors for any material (in progress)
* `standard.sh` - generate folders and images of relaxed structure
* `update.sh` - updates similar files at once (use with caution)
